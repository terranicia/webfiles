Summary

I am a marketing professional based in Atlanta, GA. I have experience developing and implementing strategic marketing plans for social media, email marketing, and the web. I also have a strong proficiency in MailChimp and Wordpress and am currently developing my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills through General Assembly’s Front-End Web Development course.


When I’m not drafting email marketing campaigns or managing social media pages, you can find me in a hot yoga session or sitting in a tea shop reading books about health and mindfulness.  


Here’s closer look at my professional experience.
